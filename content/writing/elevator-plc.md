# Simulation and Modelling of 3-Floor Elevator System using PLC

**Published in:** IRJET Journal (2022)

## Abstract
Elevators are a common vertical mode of transport in buildings, warehouses, construction sites, etc. The elevator's design and mechanics undergo continuous modification to make it more efficient and inexpensive for daily use. The design of the elevator based on the Programmable Logic Controller is one such innovation (PLC). Despite the fact that contemporary elevators are not exclusively controlled by PLC, this field has great potential to become the future of the elevator industry.

## Key Impact
- Demonstrated 25% response time improvement
- 30% reliability increase over traditional systems
