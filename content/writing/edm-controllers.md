# Comparison between Bang Bang, PID and LQR Controller for Electrical Discharge Machining Process

**Published in:** IRJET Journal (2022)
**Author:** Ajith Srikanth

## Abstract
This research presents a comprehensive comparison of different control strategies for optimizing Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) processes, evaluating the performance of Bang Bang, PID, and LQR controllers in terms of precision, stability, and efficiency.

## Key Impact
- Achieved 15-20% precision improvement
- 10% variability reduction in EDM processes
