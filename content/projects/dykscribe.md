# DykScribe: AI-Powered Knowledge Capture

## Overview
DykScribe is an intelligent Q&A system designed to capture and digitize the "tribal knowledge" of field service technicians. By leveraging OpenAI's Whisper for transcription and GPT-4 for information extraction, it transforms spoken troubleshooting sessions into structured, searchable data.

## The Challenge
*   **Knowledge Loss**: 30+ years of expertise was leaving with retiring technicians.
*   **Manual Burden**: Technicians spent 2-3 hours weekly typing reports.
*   **Data Silos**: Valuable troubleshooting insights were trapped in emails and unsearchable documents.

## The Solution
I built a browser-based application that allows technicians to record audio summaries of their site visits. The system automatically:
1.  **Transcribes** the audio using OpenAI Whisper.
2.  **Extracts** key Q&A pairs using GPT-4.
3.  **Structures** the data into a standardized format.
4.  **Stores** it in a SQL Server database for future retrieval.

## Impact
*   **Efficiency**: Reduced reporting time from 2 hours to 15 minutes per week.
*   **Knowledge Retention**: Successfully captured hundreds of troubleshooting scenarios that would have otherwise been lost.
*   **ROI**: Delivered a 900% return on investment in the first year through productivity gains and error reduction.
