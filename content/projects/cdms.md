# CDMS: Container Management System

## Overview
CDMS is a comprehensive web application designed to manage the complex documentation and tracking requirements of international shipping containers. It replaces a fragmented system of Excel sheets and email threads with a centralized, secure platform.

## The Challenge
*   **Chaos**: Managing shipping documents for 500+ containers across 20+ projects was a manual, error-prone process.
*   **Compliance**: Missing documents often led to customs delays and fines.
*   **Visibility**: Stakeholders lacked real-time insight into shipment status.

## The Solution
I architected and built a full-stack solution featuring:
*   **Role-Based Access**: Secure portals for internal teams and external suppliers.
*   **Automated Organization**: Intelligent file uploading that automatically categorizes and tags documents.
*   **Real-Time Tracking**: Integration with shipping APIs to provide live status updates.
*   **Audit Trails**: Complete history of all document actions for compliance purposes.

## Impact
*   **Efficiency**: Streamlined the documentation process, reducing administrative overhead by 80%.
*   **Reliability**: Ensured 100% document compliance for tracked shipments.
*   **Scalability**: Built to handle thousands of containers and terabytes of document data.
