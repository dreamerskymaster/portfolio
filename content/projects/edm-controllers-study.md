# EDM Controllers Study - MATLAB Simulation Analysis

## Overview
This comprehensive research project focused on optimizing control strategies for Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) systems through advanced MATLAB simulation analysis. The study compared three distinct control methodologies - Bang Bang, PID, and LQR controllers - to determine the most effective approach for precision machining applications.

## Key Findings
*   **Precision**: LQR controller demonstrated superior performance with 15-20% improvement in machining precision.
*   **Stability**: PID controller showed optimal results for standard machining operations.
*   **Efficiency**: Validated the trade-offs between energy efficiency and machining speed for different control strategies.
