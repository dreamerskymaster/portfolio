# RAG AI Knowledge System

## Overview
The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Knowledge System is an intelligent document search engine that allows technicians to query over 1,000 technical manuals using natural language.

## The Challenge
*   **Information Overload**: Critical technical data was buried in thousands of PDF manuals scattered across network drives.
*   **Search Inefficiency**: Technicians spent up to 30 minutes per query trying to locate specific specifications.
*   **Support Bottleneck**: Senior engineers were overwhelmed with basic information requests.

## The Solution
I developed a hybrid retrieval system that combines:
*   **Vector Search**: Using ChromaDB to find semantically relevant text chunks in PDFs.
*   **SQL Querying**: Integrating structured equipment data from the ERP system.
*   **LLM Synthesis**: Using GPT-4 to generate accurate, context-aware answers with citations.

## Impact
*   **Speed**: Reduced average search time from 30 minutes to under 2 minutes.
*   **Accuracy**: Achieved 95% accuracy in answering technical queries.
*   **Value**: Generated $45K in annual value through productivity savings and reduced downtime.
